## Distributing Our Diner

This project can be used as a starter for a distributing our diner using RESTful distributed system techniques

started from https://github.com/NewGerard-Lab8/diner
adding a base controller with CRUD methods.

The back-end webapp will have the following changes from the starter:

- the Welcome controller will exist, but only to show a "go away" message
- added a Maintenance controller, which acts as a REST server
- all other controllers are removed
- the only model you will have will be the Menu one; the others will be gone
- incorporate the RESTful package from the Jedi Academy
